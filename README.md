# Algolia Appstore front-end

[View demo](https://appstore.ntorres.com)

## Run locally

```
git clone git@github.com:noclat/appstore-front.git
cd appstore-front
npm install
npm start
```

## Notes

- Due to broken icons URLs in the original `data.json`, I scrapped them and compiled my own dataset. iOS-only apps icons are still missing due to iTunes website redirections to the desktop app. They are replaced by a placeholder.
- Bonus feature: mobile-first, try to add it to your home screen!
